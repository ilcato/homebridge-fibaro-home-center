# Workflow to publish to npm.

# It starts automatically every time when a new Github Release is published
# (or change from draft to public).

# Automatically detects if there should be a latest or beta version:
# when a Github Release is marked as a pre-release it will publish as beta.

# Get the version from the Github Release tag. 
# For the latest version it should be in the style of 1.2.3 
# and for the beta version in the style of 1.2.3-beta.0 .

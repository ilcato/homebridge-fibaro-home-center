# Workflow to publish to NPM.

# It starts automatically when a new Github Release is published
# or the draft is changed to a public version

# Automatically detects if there should be a latest or beta version.
# When a Github Release is marked as a Pre-release it will publish to NPM as beta.

# Get the version from the Github Release tag. 
# For the latest version it should be like: 1.2.3 
# and for the beta version like: 1.2.3-beta.0 .

# Github Release description for Pre-releases (beta) is not required.

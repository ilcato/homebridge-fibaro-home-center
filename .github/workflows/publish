# Workflow to publish to NPM.

# It starts automatically when a new Github Release is published
# or the draft is changed to a public version.
# It will not start for drafts.

# Automatically detects if there should be a latest or beta version.
# When a Github Release is marked as a Pre-release it will publish to NPM as beta.

# Get version from the Github Release tag. 
# For latest version it should be like: 1.2.3 , 1.2.4 , 1.3.0 , etc.
# For beta version it should be like: 1.2.3-beta.0 , 1.2.3-beta.1 , 1.2.3-beta.2 , etc.

# Github Release description for Pre-releases (beta) is not required.
